The Jupyter Notebooks in this directory are made by
Doug Latornell for sharing of Python code techniques and notes.
They are about the SalishSeaCast_hourly_prod NEMO configuration created in Apr-2025.
The config is for runs of a version of SalishSeaCast v202111 modified by Tall
for collaboration with Sacchi to compare model results with observation from 22-27
August 2024 near the northwest end of Texada Island.
