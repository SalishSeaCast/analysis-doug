The Jupyter Notebooks in this directory are made by
Doug Latornell for sharing of Python code techniques
and notes.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.jupyter.org](https://nbviewer.org/).
Descriptions below the links are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

* ## [retiding.ipynb](https://nbviewer.org/github/SalishSeaCast/analysis-doug/blob/main/notebooks/becca-retiding/retiding.ipynb)  
    
    **Riffing on Becca's "re-tiding" problem**
    
    Experiment to assess the reconstruction of hourly baroclinic currents
    from hourly barotropic currents and daily baroclinic currents like
    the products available from CIOPS-West.
    
    Lot's of intermediate display of data arrays to keep tabs on how the
    dask task graph develops.
    
    Static rendering of this notebook is better on nbviewer than on GitHub
    because nbviewer renders the fancy numpy/xarray reprs as intended.
    
    The conda environment description for running this notebook is in the
    `environment.yaml` file in the same directory as the notebook.
