The Jupyter Notebooks in this directory are made by
Doug Latornell for sharing of Python code techniques
and notes.
They are about exploration of processing of SalishSeaCast V2021-11 u & v current fields to
calculate current-corrected vessel velocities from EMSA program AIS messages.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.jupyter.org](https://nbviewer.org/).
Descriptions below the links are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).
